# Create a new file.
# Create two variables, one that contains the name of your hometown and one that contains statistics about your hometown.
# Create a function that calculates the population density of your hometown, you might need to add more statistics to your statistics variables now.
# Create a function that returns a sentence telling users the population density of your hometown
# Call the function and print it out.
# What happens if there is no hometown variable stored, can we put a default in place instead?
# Can you reduce the number of lines of code youâ€™ve written. Spend some time refactoring.
